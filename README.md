#Level Up project

LevelUp is up my personal passion project that I have been thinking about for some time. In my journey learning development there have been a lot of different strategies and techniques that I have learned and utilized to deal with motivation, discipline, habit building and goal planning. I have shared what I've learned with people in different coding learning communities since people are commonly challenged to stay motivated, to maintain discipline, to build good study habits and effectively plan for their goals.

I've implemented my versions of these different strategies and techniques using Google sheets, Notion and just plain post-it notes but it wasn't a great experience tracking activities across different apps and mediums. I started to think about an app that could put all of this together in one cohesive interface and would allow you to do so in a fun and engaging manner. Also, since I am a fan of video games I started to analyze the ones that I played and started thinking about the things they utilized to keep you excited to play.
